## Section 1: Phenomena of Interest (Narrative Manipulation by Social Bots)

This phenomenon focuses on how social bots are used to create misinformation networks on social media platforms, with the goal of distorting public perception and manipulating narratives. Through persona creation, social bots are able to infiltrate the social media ecosystem to interact with users or other bots for malicious purposes. 

This phenomenon arises when social bots are perceived to work together in order to manipulate public perception. An example of this is malicious social media bots imitating humans to pollute information ecosystems like controversial discussions (Javed, 2023). Bots have been shown to increase the human experience of provocative and negative comments, which causes conflicts on social media platforms and online systems (Javed, 2023). 

This eventually leads to engagement metrics tricking the algorithm to spread false information. The spread of false information can influence public sentiments and prevent different perspectives from being voiced.
