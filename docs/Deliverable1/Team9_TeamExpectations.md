## Goals

- Collaborate in a fair manner!
- Get good grades
- Make a cool project
- Maintain high communication regarding changes (personal or class-related). Give everyone a heads-up on Discord.
- Have fun with the project and minimize delays.

## Ground Rules

These define what group members expect from one another and what norms they agree on relating to behaviours and actions.

### Communication
- Give regular updates on changes, schedule, workload, etc.

### Meetings
- Have group calls once a week
- Possibly increase to twice a week as deadlines approach

### Deadlines
- Aim to complete deliverables several days before deadlines to allow for updates or corrections

## Care Statement

Outline how the team will strive to care for the health of each other and the team as a whole during the project duration:

- Each member is responsible for their own health, i.e., communicating with teammates about their mental and physical health so the team can find solutions together.
- Everything is a group effort.
- Everyone has individual strengths and weaknesses, so we support each other where needed.
- Accountability is important.
- Regular meetings to track progress and avoid negligent behavior.

## Performance Agreement

Considers how the group will address non-performance of what is agreed to. Whatever the group agrees upon should correspond to the impact or gravity of the issues at hand.

## Signatures to the Agreement

If team members cannot add signatures in person, a group can agree that each member typing their name in the signature section suffices as agreement.
